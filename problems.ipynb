    "The Sigma0 function has been successfully implemented according to FIPS PUB 180-4 specifications. It combines three right rotations (by 2, 13, and 22 positions) using XOR to provide non-linearity in SHA-256's compression function. All tests pass, confirming the implementation correctly follows the standard. This function, along with the ROTR helper, forms an essential component of the SHA-256 hash algorithm.\n"

    "\n",
    "What it does:\n",
    "\n",
    "Sigma1 is like Sigma0's partner - it also scrambles a 32-bit word by rotating it three different ways and XORing them together. While Σ₀ works on variable 'a' in SHA-256, Σ₁ works on variable 'e'.\n",

    "Rotate x right by 6 positions (bits wrap around)\n",
    "Rotate x right by 11 positions\n",
    "Rotate x right by 25 positions\n",

    "Original x:  10110100\n",
    "ROTR 6:      01101011 (6 bits wrap)\n",
    "ROTR 11→3:   10010110 (wraps around in 8-bit)\n",

    "XOR all:     Result\n",
    "The actual function uses 32 bits for stronger scrambling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Where its Used:\n",
    "\n",
    "Used in SHA-256's round function to calculate T₁, which updates the working variables during each of the 64 rounds (FIPS 180-4, Section 4.1.2, Equation 4.5, page 10).\n",

    "Different rotation amounts mean Σ₀ and Σ₁ scramble bits differently, providing stronger security when used together.\n",
    "\n",
    "Real World Analogy:\n",
    "\n",
    "If Σ₀ is shuffling a deck by cutting it at positions 2, 13, and 22, then Σ₁ is shuffling by cutting at positions 6, 11, and 25. Using both makes the shuffle much harder to reverse."

    "\n",
    "Problem 2 demonstrates the derivation of SHA-256s 64 round constants from mathematical foundations, specifically the fractional parts of cube roots of the first 64 prime numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach validates the cryptographic principle of \"nothing up my sleeve\" the constants are derived from well known mathematical sequences rather than arbitrary values that could hide backdoors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematical Process\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The generation process involves:\n",
    "\n",
    "Generating the first 64 prime numbers: [2, 3, 5, 7, ... 311]\n",
    "Computing the cube root of each prime\n",
    "Extracting the fractional part (portion after the decimal point).\n",
    "Converting the first 32 bits of the fractional part to hexadecimal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Verification Results\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "All 64 generated constants match precisely with those specified in FIPS PUB 180-4, Section 4.2.2. This verification confirms both the correctness of our implementation and the reproducibility of the SHA-256 standard. The deterministic nature of this generation process provides transparency and builds trust in the algorithm's design.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cryptographic Significance:\n",
    "Using cube roots of primes serves multiple purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Transparency: Anyone can verify the constants independently.\n",
    "\n",
    "No hidden structure: Mathematical constants appear random, preventing exploitation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Historical precedent: Similar to SHA256s initial hash values (from square roots of primes).\n",
    "\n",
    "Standardization: Ensures all implementations use identical constants\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem bridges theoretical mathematics and practical cryptography, showing how number theory contributes to secure hash algorithm design.\n",
